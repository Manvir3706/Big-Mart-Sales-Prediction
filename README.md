Data
The dataset used in this project contains information about Big Mart store sales. The key features include:

Store_ID: Identifier for the store
Item_ID: Identifier for the item
Sales: Sales amount (target variable)
Date: Date of the sales record
Other features: Various features that may affect sales (e.g., item type, store location, promotions, etc.)
Note: The dataset file should be placed in the data/ directory.

Model
We use XGBoost Regressor for predicting sales. Key steps include:

Data Preparation: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
Feature Engineering: Creating and selecting relevant features.
Training: Training the XGBoost model with optimal hyperparameters.
Evaluation: Using metrics like MAE, MSE, or RMSE to assess model performance.
