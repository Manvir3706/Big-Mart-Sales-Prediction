## Installation
To run this project, you'll need to install the following dependencies. You can use pip to install them:

1. bash
2. Copy code
3. pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost matplotlib
4. Data
   
### The dataset used in this project contains information about Big Mart store sales. The key features include:

1. Store_ID: Identifier for the store
2. Item_ID: Identifier for the item
3. Sales: Sales amount (target variable)
4. Date: Date of the sales record
5. Other features: Various features that may affect sales (e.g., item type, store location, promotions, etc.)

   
Note: The dataset file should be placed in the data/ directory.

## Model
We use XGBoost Regressor for predicting sales. Key steps include:

1. Data Preparation: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
2. Feature Engineering: Creating and selecting relevant features.
3. Training: Training the XGBoost model with optimal hyperparameters.
4. Evaluation: Using metrics like MAE, MSE, or RMSE to assess model performance.
